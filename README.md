# Music-Store-Analysis-PostgreSQL
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of a Music Store Database, employing PostgreSQL on the PgAdmin4 tool. The database utilized a star schema, connecting multiple data tables to facilitate a holistic exploration of data relationships. This project demanded a deep understanding of SQL concepts to derive meaningful insights.

**Analysis Highlights:**

Question Set 1 - Easy

1. Who is the senior most employee based on job title?
2. Which countries have the most Invoices?
3. What are top 3 values of total invoice?
4. Which city has the best customers? We would like to throw a promotional Music
Festival in the city we made the most money. Write a query that returns one city that
has the highest sum of invoice totals. Return both the city name & sum of all invoice
totals
5. Who is the best customer? The customer who has spent the most money will be
declared the best customer. Write a query that returns the person who has spent the
most money

Question Set 2 – Moderate

1. Write query to return the email, first name, last name, & Genre of all Rock Music
listeners. Return your list ordered alphabetically by email starting with A
2. Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset. Write a
query that returns the Artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands
3. Return all the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length.
Return the Name and Milliseconds for each track. Order by the song length with the
longest songs listed first

Question Set 3 – Advance

1. Find how much amount spent by each customer on artists? Write a query to return
customer name, artist name and total spent
2. We want to find out the most popular music Genre for each country. We determine the
most popular genre as the genre with the highest amount of purchases. Write a query
that returns each country along with the top Genre. For countries where the maximum
number of purchases is shared return all Genres
3. Write a query that determines the customer that has spent the most on music for each
country. Write a query that returns the country along with the top customer and how
much they spent. For countries where the top amount spent is shared, provide all
customers who spent this amount

**Tools Used:**
Database: PostgreSQL
Query Tool: PgAdmin4

Schema:

The Music Store Analysis project has been a dynamic journey, highlighting the pivotal role of joins in unraveling complex queries within star schemas. Navigating through diverse data tables with PostgreSQL on PgAdmin4 not only sharpened my technical prowess but also instilled a strategic problem-solving mindset. The challenges encountered served as stepping stones, fostering a deeper understanding of intricate database structures. I encourage every data aspirant to embrace such challenges, as theyprovide a unique opportunity for growth and skill enhancement in the fascinating realm of data analysis.
